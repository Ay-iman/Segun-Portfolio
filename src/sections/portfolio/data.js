    title: "Why is CTA so important in marketing? ",
    desc: "1.	Why are CTAs so important to have on the website? A call to action on a website is usually referred to what the marketer wants the consumer to do next. CTA is used in all kinds of industries: FromTV commercials,that want you to dial the number on a screen and order certain products, to some charity organizations wanting you to subscribe to their monthly letter with the “donate now” button.  On a commercial website, CTA usually replaces the position of the salesman, guiding the user through the website and making them buy products and services. Good CTA takes the pain away from the user by making the navigation intuitive, swift, and less complicated. A well-designed CTA, just like a professional salesman, attracts customers and makes them intuitively want to spend money on your website. Helping customers easily find what they need and suggesting what might be handy for them is a win-win for both the client and the seller.  ",
